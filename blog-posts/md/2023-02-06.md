“很久以前看學中文的外國人說，他認為「水開了」是很風雅的說法，沸水翻騰，就像花朵盛開。而以中文為母語的人如我，「水開了」不過是日常說法，千萬遍使用過來，很難提煉詩意。

因此想到詞語本身也會磨損，使用過多，就會淪為與針線無異的死物。好像大雪，豐盛落過壹場，消失殆盡。「夜深知雪重，時聞折竹聲。」白居易用這兩句形容千年前唐朝夜裏的壹次落雪。而我有時聽見詞匯在語句裏發出脆響，也是壹種折竹聲，正是詞語最豐饒的時刻。”

My interpretaion in English:
Some Chinese learners think the expression of "water blooms" (meaning water is boiling in Chinese) is very elegent, which is comparing the image of water boiling to how flowers bloom. However, it's hard to find this delicacy in it as a native speaker, since it is just one of those common expressions we use everyday.

Vocabularies get washed out. They fade after being used extensively, just as how snow eventually disappears no matter how heavy it was. "We know how heavy the snow is late at night, when we hear bamboos breaking from time to time." Poet Bai Juyi described a snowy night thousands year ago in the Tang Dynasty. I sometimes too, can hear the "bamboo breaking" sounds of words in sentences, when the words are in their golden hours.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

So I love reading literatures in the languages they were written in (well, not necessarily, because I only understand Chinese and English, sadly) even though it might take longer. A lot of those "bamboo breaking" sounds of words are lost in translation no matter how skilled the translators are or how well-tuned the translation models are.

I found it so diffucult translating the above paragraph from Chinese to English. Although most of the words/phrases/characters have according translations in other languages, it can be hard for readers to understand why the writer chose to use a word over another to express something when they got translated to the same word. And, as a call back, we can't see how in Chinese we say the water "blooms" when it translates to "boils" when we map it to an English word based on the meaning solely.

For so long I have only been thinking about how we can help preserve those low-resource languages (NLP? ML? DL?), but I haven't thought about how those "bamboo breaking" sounds can be gone too even if they are in languages that thousands of people are using everyday. I feel so little when I don't get and can't use as comfortably those native expressions in Cantonese, and have to translate words from Mandarin when unsure. Some interesting examples can be found from Cantonese spoken in Guangdong and Hong Kong. Here's one: fridge in Hong Kong Cantonese: syut3 gwai6 雪櫃 (snow cabinet), fridge in Guangdong Cantonese: bing1 soeng1 冰箱 (ice box) -- the Guangdong Cantonese is the literal translation of the word from Mandarin Chinese.

I found [this](https://zh.wikipedia.org/zh-hans/%E4%BF%A1%E8%BE%BE%E9%9B%85) a good general guideline for translation

信达雅 -- faithfulness, expressiveness, and elegance
